### Service account credential

Provide here a default service account when using the docker-compose command. In order to use a default google
service account, you need to specify the environment variable. See 
[Authenticating as a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) for additional 
information on how to create a service account key and use it locally. 

Name the credentials file `gsa-key.json` and store it under this subdirectory.
